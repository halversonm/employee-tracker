# Employee Tracker

## Description
Use this command-line application to easily view and manage your company's employee database. No developing expertise needed for using this application as it is very user-friendly! By creating this application I was able to further improve my developer skills in mySQL.

## Installation
Run: "npm i" to install the necessary npm packages for this application. MySQL is also required for this application.

## Usage
Before using the Employee Tracker Application, make sure to enter in your mySQL username, password, and database information in index.js to ensure connection to your mySQL server. To start the application, enter: "node index.js" in your terminal. From here you will be prompted with the main menu. Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu and press the enter button to make a selection.
